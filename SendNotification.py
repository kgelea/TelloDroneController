This script will be the template to send a notification to a phone via the Telegram API

STEPS TO TAKE BEFORE:
1) Get a Telegram account (free) using your phone number
Web: https://web.telegram.org Also download the Telegram Android. 

2) Go into settings (web or app) and set a username
This is needed to obtain an id which your bot will use to send messages to.

3) Send a message to RawDataBot to get your id
Just search for RawDataBot and send any message (hi will do). Take a note of your id.

4) Create your bot (which you'll command with HTTP requests)
Now search for BotFather and send the message /start. Help is displayed. 
Send the message /newbot and follow the instructions. 
Take a note of your token to access the HTTP API
